1. Create the graph in the form of adjacency list 
2. For each vertex in the graph, 
    - if it is not visited:
        -> DFS down until you hit a sink node 
        -> Mark it visited 
        -> push that onto the stack
    - if all of its children have been visited
        - Mark it as visited
        -> add it to the stack 

RUNTIME: 
    -> Visiting all edges and vertices (O(|V| + |E|))
