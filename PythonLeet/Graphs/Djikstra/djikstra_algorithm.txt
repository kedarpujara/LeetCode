GOAL:
Shortest path from source node to every other node in the graph


SETUP:
DIST map for each vertex set to inf
PriorityQueue
PREV -- what is currently set as it previous 


1. Set dist[src] = 0
2. Push src onto PriorityQueue 
3. While queue:
    - curr = pq.pop()
    - for neighbor of graph[curr]:
        -> if (dist[u to v] plus dist[u]) < dist[v]
            - set dist[v] to be dist[u to v] plus dist[u]
            - Push neighbors/edges onto priority queue
            - Set prev[v] to be u
